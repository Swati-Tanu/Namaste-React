Library Vs Framework - 

In cdn link the first one (react.development) consists core react code. While the second one (react-dom.development) consists code to modify the dom. We have two seperate files because React works on browsers, mobile phones, as 3D etc.

Since writing nesting code using React core can be a tedius work that is why we use JSX.

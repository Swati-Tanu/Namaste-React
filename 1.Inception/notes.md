# React - A JavaScript Library 

#### It was developed by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook.

#### React can be injected into a portion of our app too, the app doesn't not have to be completely build by React. For eg, only header can be built using React.

### In cdn link the first one (react.development) consists core react code. While the second one (react-dom.development) consists code to modify the dom. We have two seperate files because React works on browsers, mobile phones, as 3D etc.

### The order of script files matters, whether CDN links or just importing the index.js link.

### Since writing nesting code using React core can be a tedius work that is why we use JSX.

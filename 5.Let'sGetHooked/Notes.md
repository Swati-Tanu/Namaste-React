### Two types of Export/Import

1. Default Export/Import
export default variable_name;
import variable_name from "path";

2. Named Export/Import
export const variable_name;
import {variable_name} from "path";

When exporting two or more thing then only use Named Export/Import.

Fun question: Can we use a Default Export/Import along with Named Export/Import?
Answer: Yes

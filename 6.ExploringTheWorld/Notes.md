#### Monolith (big bulky project) Architecture and Microservice(small services) Architecture

Microservice Architecture is also known as seperation of concern, and follows single responsibility principle.

In React for fetching data from API snd displaying we use the following approach:

Loads -> Render -> API -> Re-render

#### useEffect is a React Hook that calls a callback function once the component is already rendered.

#### The major reason we use useState is to make our component dynamic. Because it such case javascript doesnot work. Example in Header.js file, when clicking the Login button OR Body.js with Search Bar. And whenever we change something using useState the whole component is called once again.

Whenever state variable updates React triggers a reconciliation cycle or re-renders the component.

#### Monolith (big bulky project) Architecture and Microservice(small services) Architecture

Microservice Architecture is also known as seperation of concern, and follows single responsibility principle.

In React for fetching data from API snd displaying we use the following approach:

Loads -> Render -> API -> Re-render

#### useEffect is a React Hook that calls a callback function once the component is already rendered.
